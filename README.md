## What is AnnieARNyouOkey??

AnnieARNyouOkey is automatic computational pipeline specifically designed for the analysis of RNA-seq data. It starts processing raw fastq files and generates lists of differentially expressed genes. The analysis are performed according to user specified parameters. AnnieARNyouOkey must be executed in a sequential mode in a laptop, not in a distributed/parallel mode in a computer cluster.
